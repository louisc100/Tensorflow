A common example of NLP is something like spell check or autocomplete. Essentially, NLP is the field that focuses on how computers can understand and/or process natural/human languages."

Take for example our image data, it was simply a tensor of shape (width, height, channels). That data doesn't change or care about the notion of time.\n",

Unlike images, sequences data such as long chains of text, weather patterns, videos and really anything where the notion of a step or time is relevant need to be processed and handled in a special way.\n",

    "But what do I mean by sequences and why is text data a sequence? Since textual data contains many words that follow in a very specific and meaningful order we need to be able to keep track of each word and when it occurs in the data. Simply encoding say an entire paragraph of text into one data point wouldn't give us a very meaningful picture of the data and would be very difficult to do anything with. This is why we treat text as a sequence and process one word at a time. We will keep track of where each of these words appear and use that information to try to understand the meaning of pieces of text."

Up until this point, we have been using something called **feed-forward** neural networks. This simply means that all of our data is def forwards (all at once) from left to right through the network. This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for procesing text. After all even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. This is exactly what a recurrent neural network is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop. A RNN will process one word at a time while maintaining an internal memory of what it's already seen. This will allow it to treat words differently based on their order in a sentence and to slowly build an understanding of the entire output, one word at a time.\n",

Whereas in our simple RNN layer input from previous timestamps gradually disappeared as we got further through the input. With a LSTM we have a long term memory data structure storing all of the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw the. This allows for us to access any precious value we want at any point in time. This adds to the complexity of our network and allows it to discover more useful relationships between inputs and when they appear."
